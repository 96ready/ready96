    %h2 Preparedness is all about people.
    %p History has taught us one thing: people are most resilient in emergencies when they are connected to others. The kind of connections that are meaningful to us in everyday life become even more crucial during an emergency.
    %p But recent emergencies, including Sandy, Boston and Fukushima, have shown that there is also an emerging role for technology in emergency response. In fact, text messaging is one of the most reliable forms of communication in an emergency, since it is unlikely that all networks will go down.
    %p The SF72 app is designed to bring together these two simple facts.
