      %p Emergency planning can feel overwhelming. We’ve broken it down into simple steps and provided tools that will make it feel do-able. The same connections that are important in everyday life—with friends, family, neighbors, and communities—are even more crucial in a crisis.
  .meet-up
    %h2 Set up your meet up.
    %p First, make an emergency plan with your inner circle of friends, relatives, or immediate family. That way, you will each know what to do in an emergency.
  .plan-basics
    %h2 What basics does your plan need to include?
    .plan-list
      %ul
        %li.select <strong>Select a few of your nearest and dearest.</strong> Who’s the group you’ll want to get in touch with if something happens?
        %li.pick <strong>Pick an out of state contact.</strong> Who can serve as a hub for information, if you can’t reach others in your local area?
        %li.agree <strong>Agree on a place to meet. </strong> How about a park? A landmark? Don’t choose a house—in case it’s inaccessible.
  .basics-slider
    %h2 Learn tips.
    %p Read and print our #{@quick_guide.title} Guide to learn a few easy steps to keep your cool when the earth shakes.
