				%h2 What is SF72?
				%p SF72 is San Francisco’s hub for emergency preparedness. Our mission is to enable San Franciscans to get prepared. The best way to do this is for us to get connected to each other and share resources. If we can be prepared for the first 72 hours after a disaster, we will be ready for an emergency, no matter what form it takes.
