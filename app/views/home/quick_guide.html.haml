				%h2 Drop, cover and hold
				%p Drop where you are, get under a strong table or desk, and hold onto the legs. If you are not near a table, drop and cover your head and neck with your arms against an interior wall. Move away from windows.
			%li
				%h2 Stay put
				%p Whether you’re in a car, bed, or public place, stay put and hold tight until the shaking stops. If you’re outdoors, steer clear of wires or falling objects. The only exception to this rule: If you are near the coast, immediately go to high ground, as earthquakes are nature’s warning for a tsunami.
			%li
				%h2 Stay calm
				%p Keep calm and carry on. Keeping your wits about you will ensure that you make safe choices for yourself and those around you.

				%h2 Check your surroundings
				%p Check for damage, and for anyone who is injured and in need of attention.
			%li
				%h2 Leave a trail
				%p If you leave home, leave a sign telling friends and family your location. Digitally savvy? Send a tweet or Facebook update telling everyone know that you’re ok.
			%li
				%h2 Stay tuned
				%p Listen to the radio for important information and instructions. Remember that aftershocks, which generally follow large quakes, can be large enough to cause damage in their own right.
			%li
				%h2 Check SF72
				%p In the event of an emergency, this site will go into Emergency Mode where it will provide a live stream of updates from the City as well as crowdsourced citizen reports.
