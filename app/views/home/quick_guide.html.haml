				%h2 Drop, cover and hold.
				%p Duck under a strong table or desk. Cover your head and neck with your arms against an interior wall. Stay away from windows.
			%li
				%h2 Stay calm.
				%p Keep calm and carry on. Keeping your wits about you will ensure that you make safe choices for yourself and those around you.
			%li
				%h2 Stay put.
				%p Shelter in place–whether you’re in a car, in bed, or in a public place. Do not try to run out of the building during strong shaking, hold tight until the shaking stops. If you’re outdoors, steer clear of wires or falling objects.

				%h2 Check your surroundings.
				%p Check for damage, and for anyone who is injured and in need of attention.
			%li
				%h2 Leave a trail.
				%p If you leave home, leave a sign telling friends and family your location. Digitaly savvy? Send a tweet or Facebook update telling everyone know that you’re ok. Note: Earthquakes are nature&apos;s warning for a tsunami. If you are near the coast, go to high ground.
			%li
				%h2 Stay tuned.
				%p Listen to the radio for important information and instructions. Remember that aftershocks, which generally follow large quakes, can be large enough to cause damage in their own right.
			%li
				%h2 Check SF72.
