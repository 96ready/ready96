      %h2 We believe in connection,<br /> not catastrophe.
      %p Here&apos;s the thing: actual emergencies look more like people coming together than cities falling apart. In fact, people who are more connected fare better in the face of crisis.
      %p SF72 is a new platform, designed to help San Francisco build connections and prepare for emergencies before something happens to the city we love. This way, we can act swiftly, safely and efficiently if disaster strikes. And we can show the world just how connected we are.

      %span In the event of an emergency, this site will go into Emergency Mode where it will provide a live stream of updates from the City as well as crowdsourced citizen reports.
