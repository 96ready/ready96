		%h2 We believe in connection, not catastrophe.
		%p Hereâ€™s the thing: actual emergencies look more like people coming together than cities falling apart.
		%p If we can be prepared for the first 72 hours after a disaster, we will be ready for an emergency, no matter what form it takes. 72 hours might seem like a lot, but that's really only nine meals. It's just a long weekend.
